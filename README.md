# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This notebook uses data from [this kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) to detect fraud on credit card. To do so I used some basic models such as logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost (not that basic), paying attetion paying attention to the unbalanced nature of the problem in order to better choose metrics and sampling.
